# Node.js Example for TLS Notary

This directory contains a Node.js example application that demonstrates how to use the TLS Notary system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

## File Structure

- `app.js`: This is the main application file.
- `package.json`: This file contains the list of npm dependencies for the application.

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the application

```sh
node index.js
```

## Usage

This application demonstrates how to use the `zknotary-verifier` npm package in a Node.js application.

It takes two inputs:

- A generic proof of notarization generated by TLSNotary.
- The Notary's public key as a pem file.

Here is a sample usage:

We need to import the `zknotary-verifier` package which contains the WebAssembly code that does the actual verification of the proof. We also import the `zknotary-parsers` package, which provides an utility to parse the output of the verifier's `verify()` function. In this particular case, the sample proof corresponds to the notarization of a session with the Twitter API, so we import only the Twitter parser.

```js
import * as wasm from "zknotary-verifier";
import { twitter } from "zknotary-parsers";
```

Then, we read from file both the sample proof in JSON format as well as the Notary's public key:

```js
const proof_json = await readFile("./sample_proof.json");
const notary_pubkey = await readFile("./notary.pub");
```

Finally we execute the `verify()` function passing as parameters the proof and the public key. We send to the console the result of the parsing:

```js
try {
  const result = wasm.verify(proof_json, notary_pubkey);
  const parsedData = twitter.parse(result);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(parsedData, null, 2));
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Verification failed:", e);
}
```
