# Verifier

## Introduction

The Verifier component of zkNotary is a crucial tool for validating the authenticity of data notarized by the Prover. It's a WebAssembly module compiled from Rust, using [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/introduction.html), and is designed for use within JavaScript applications.

## Features

- **WebAssembly Compilation**: The Rust code is compiled into WebAssembly, making it suitable for integration in web environments.
- **Single Public Function - `verify`**: Exposes a function that takes `proof_json` and `notary_pubkey` as inputs and returns a plain-text notarization of the original interaction with a web server.
- **Digital Signature Validation**: Validates that the proof was digitally signed by the notary server, ensuring authenticity.

## Prerequisites

- Rust
- Cargo
- wasm-pack

Note: This project requires a clang version newer than 16.0.0 to compile ring to wasm. If not, you will run into warning: error: unable to create target: 'No available targets are compatible with triple "wasm32-unknown-unknown"'

## File Structure

- `src/lib.rs`: This is the main library file for the Verifier.
- `src/utils.rs`: This file contains utility functions used by the Verifier.
- `pkg`: Autogenerated directory where the npm package code lives.
- `examples/node`: A sample node application that showcases how to use the verifier package. For more information see the sample application's [README](./examples/node/README.md) file.

## Usage

1. Install wasm-pack

```sh
npm install -g wasm-pack
```

2. Optional: For Mac users with a version of clang older than 16.0.0, you can use Homebrew to install `llvm` and then use it to compile the project.

```sh
brew install llvm
echo 'export PATH="/path/to/your/newly/installed/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. Build the wasm project

```sh
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

This creates a new `pkg` directory with the wasm package ready to publish to npmjs.com.

4. Publish your npm package

```sh
cd pkg
npm publish
```
